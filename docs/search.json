During my time at Occidental and since graduating, I worked as the Field Administrator for the Pasadena-based land trust, Arroyos & Foothills Conservancy (AFC). My work involved coordinating and leading environmental educational field trips for K-12 students on AFC’s conserved properties, building public awareness around conservation, and monitoring wildlife cameras. I used these wildlife cameras, along with community science and landscape data, to study connectivity among urban wildlife populations and to determine optimal placement of wildlife corridors in Los Angeles.\r\nSwitzer Falls, Los Angles, CAInterests\r\nDriven by a desire to protect wildlife and natural open spaces, I came to Bren to pursue the Conservation Planning specialization. I strongly believe in the importance of educating and working with the public to solve environmental issues, as well as including community scientists in scientific research, a topic I studied in-depth during my undergraduate research. This inspired me to pursue the Strategic Environmental Communication and Media Focus, through which I hope to instill in others enthusiasm and an appreciation for the natural world.\r\nIn my free time, I can often be found out hiking or swimming in the ocean. Outside of my love for nature, I enjoy singing, baking, painting, and learning Kalari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
