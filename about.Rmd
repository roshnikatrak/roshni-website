**Experience**

I received my Bachelor of Arts in Biology with a concentration in Environmental Science from Occidental College in 2019. During my time at Occidental and since graduating, I worked as the Field Administrator for the Pasadena-based land trust, Arroyos & Foothills Conservancy (AFC). My work involved coordinating and leading environmental educational field trips for K-12 students on AFCâ€™s conserved properties, building public awareness around conservation, and monitoring wildlife cameras. I used these wildlife cameras, along with community science and landscape data, to study connectivity among urban wildlife populations and to determine optimal placement of wildlife corridors in Los Angeles.

**Interests**

Driven by a desire to protect wildlife and natural open spaces, I came to Bren to pursue the Conservation Planning specialization. I strongly believe in the importance of educating and working with the public to solve environmental issues, as well as including community scientists in scientific research, a topic I studied in-depth during my undergraduate research. This inspired me to pursue the Strategic Environmental Communication and Media Focus, through which I hope to instill in others enthusiasm and an appreciation for the natural world.

In my free time, I can often be found out hiking or swimming in the ocean. Outside of my love for nature, I enjoy singing, baking, painting, and learning Kalari.
